Material Design layouts encourage consistency across platforms, environments, and screen sizes by using uniform elements and spacing.

## Principles of Layout

**Predictable** - Use intuitive and predictable layouts with consistent UI regions and spatial organization.  
**Consistent** - Layouts should be consistent in the use of grids, keylines, and padding.  
**Responsive** - Layouts are adaptive and they react to input from a user, a device, and screen elements.
